<div class="wrap">
	<h3>Bug - Inaccurate backend company data with the data from the frontend</h3>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Test case :</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li> Create new company from frontend with user role Job Lister</li>
		<li> Add at least one company services, clients, and portofolio</li>
		<li> Edit post that you just added from the frontend via wp-admin</li>
		<li> The company data such as services, clients, portofolio has gone</li>
		<li> But the data is not actually gone</li>
	</ol>
	<p>With this plugin, company data inputted from frontend will be readable in the backend,<br>
	and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>
